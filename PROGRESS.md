## ðŸ“… October 28, 2025 - Day 1: Setup

**Today's Goal:**
- [x] Create folder structure
- [x] Get Redis running
- [x] Create shared types
- [ ] Basic server responding to /health

**What I Built:**
- Complete monorepo folder structure (apps, services, packages, docs)
- Docker Compose configuration for Redis
- Redis container running and responding to PONG
- Shared TypeScript types package with FollowUpPayload, AgentQuestions, and Socket.IO event interfaces
- pnpm workspace configuration

**Problems I Hit:**
- PowerShell here-string formatting for docker-compose.yml had extra spaces
- Had to understand the difference between pnpm init defaults vs what's needed for TypeScript package

**Solutions I Found:**
- Used file creation tool to generate properly formatted docker-compose.yml
- Learned that shared types package needs main/types/exports pointing to .ts files, not .js

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Complete Step 4: Create basic Node.js server with /health endpoint
- Start Day 2: Build Reviewer React app
- Get WebSocket connections working

**Notes:**
- Michael clarified timeline - needs to be done in 2-3 days (first come first serve)
- Using gpt-4o-mini for cost efficiency
- Simple XREAD for Redis (no consumer groups needed)
- Web Speech API is acceptable for voice capture
- Component diagram preferred for architecture

**Time spent today:** ~2 hours
